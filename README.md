# lights-out

Purpose
========
A simple game of Lights Out that I wrote as a project for COMP1406 (Intro to Computer Science II) at Carleton University

Written in JAVA, lights-out uses basic GUI concepts. The game starts out by initializing an array of buttons for the user that can be one of four colours. By pressing any button, the user causes the colour of that button, AND any adjacent buttons to change to the next colour in the sequence. The game is won by turning the entire board one colour.
